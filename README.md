# Pipeline-based-Prediction-of-Gross-Income-from-Supermarket-Sales-Data
This project uses a pipeline-based approach to predict the gross income from supermarket sales data. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of two machine learning models - Gradient Boosting and XGBoost Regressor. 

## Main Function Points
* First of all, it is a self-learning purpose work 
* Preprocess and clean the supermarket sales data
* Using Pipelineing for best practice 
* Perform feature engineering to extract relevant features
* Train and evaluate two machine learning models - Gradient Boosting and XGBoost Regressor
* Compare the performance of the two models and select the best one
* Save the trained model for future use
